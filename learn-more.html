Welcome to Consensus, the ultimate tool for planning group trips with ease and fun! Whether you're organizing a weekend getaway with friends, a family vacation, or a team-building retreat, Consensus makes group decision-making simple and stress-free.

How It Works
Create a New Trip

As the main user, you start by creating a new trip. This will be the foundation for all your planning and collaboration.
Invite Others

Once your trip is set up, you can invite others to join. The more, the merrier! By expanding your group, you bring in more ideas and make the planning process more engaging.
Set Up Time Slots

As the group leader, you create time slots for the trip. These time slots represent different parts of your trip, such as morning, afternoon, or evening activities on each day.
Collaborate on Activities

Each member of the group can suggest activities for each time slot. This collaborative approach ensures that everyone’s interests and ideas are considered, making the trip enjoyable for all.
Vote on Activities

Here’s where the fun begins! Each group member gets one vote per time slot. The activity that receives the most votes for a given time slot wins and is automatically added to the group's itinerary.
Finalize the Itinerary

As the voting concludes, you’ll have a complete, crowd-sourced itinerary that reflects the group’s preferences. No more endless debates or indecision—Consensus brings your group’s ideas together in a way that’s fair, efficient, and fun!
